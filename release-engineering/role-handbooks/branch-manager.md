## Content Notice

The Patch Release Team and Branch Manager roles have been consolidated into a
single [Release Managers][release-managers] group.

This means that several areas of this document may currently be out of date.
While we work to update these documents, please reach out to
[Release Managers][release-managers] directly for any clarifications on Release
Engineering processes.

**This notice will be removed when the documentation is no longer under
construction.**

## Overview

### Conventions

In this handbook, we will make several references to Kubernetes releases, milestones, and [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

For the purposes of this handbook, we'll assume that:

- the current release in development is Kubernetes 1.18
- the previous release is Kubernetes 1.17
- the next release is Kubernetes 1.19
- the release no longer in support is Kubernetes 1.14

To simplify certain instructions, we will make the following connections:

| Text | SemVer | Reference Release |
|---|---|---|
| "current release", "current milestone", "in development" | `x.y` | Kubernetes 1.18 |
| "previous release", "previous milestone" | `x.y-1` | Kubernetes 1.17 |
| "next release", "next milestone" | `x.y+1` | Kubernetes 1.19 |
| "release no longer in support" | `x.y-4` | Kubernetes 1.14 |

**As an editor of this content, Branch Managers should periodically update these conventions and the examples contained within this handbook.**

### Minimum Requirements

- Familiarity with basic Unix commands and able to debug shell scripts.
- Familiarity with branched source code workflows via `git` and associated `git` command line invocations.
- General knowledge of Google Cloud (Cloud Build and Cloud Storage).
- Open to seeking help and communicating clearly.
- [Kubernetes Community Membership](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community-membership.md#member)

### Responsibilities

The release branch manager is responsible for cutting a version of [Kubernetes]. Each release is a three month cycle where as branch manager it's expected you:

1. Cut releases for the next release cycle as specified on the timeline in `sig-release/releases/release-x.y/README.md`
   - For example, during the v1.16 cycle you're expected to allocate time to cut releases on the dates detailed in [sig-release/releases/release-1.16/README.md][release-1.16]. The bulk of your time commitment is during release cut days.
1. Allocate time to setup your system to run the release tools; eventually you'll become more familiar with the process.
1. Participate in weekly one hour release team meetings.
1. Run `krel ff` as soon as the release branch (`release-x.y`) [is created](#branch-creation) on a daily basis. (Takes less than 45 minutes)
1. Dedicate additional time during [code freeze](#code-freeze) when approaching the official release (expect around three one hour meetings in a week).
1. Select Associates and guide them in preparation to become the section lead for the next cycle.
1. Delegate tasks to the Associates (where applicable), so they may participate during the release process.
1. Update this handbook where appropriate for the next release cycle.
1. Have willingness to accommodate with different time zones especially for the release team and Associates.
1. Participate in conversations that happen on [#sig-release] and [#release-management]

To get a better overview of the time it takes to run the release tools, you can take a look at the collected metrics from each of these [release cut issues][release-cut-issues].

### Associates Expectations

Release Manager Associates are apprentices to the Branch Managers, it's expected you:

1. Attend most of the release team meetings; you're highly encouraged to give suggestions, ask questions, voice thoughts, etc.
1. Know, and help with, the release dates from the [release cycle Timeline](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases).
1. Participate in discussion to improve the [release tools].
1. Question the content of this handbook. *“The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge.”*
1. Be curious and make the most out of this opportunity.

## Prerequisites

This is a collection of requirements and conditions to fulfill when taking on the role as branch manager.

### Branch Management Onboarding

**Before we can grant Release Manager access to new Branch Managers, a [Release Manager onboarding issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/new?labels=sig%2Frelease%2C+area%2Frelease-eng&template=release-manager.md&title=Release+Manager+access+for+%3CGH-handle%3E) _MUST_ be opened in this repo. Please take a moment to do that before executing the tasks contained in this handbook.**

### Machine setup

#### Operating System

There's a small amount of effort to ensure our [release tools] are supported on multiple platforms, please note that only the following systems are supported:

- Debian-like (Debian, Ubuntu)
- Fedora-like (Fedora, RHEL, CentOS)
- MacOS

Windows is not supported by [release tools].

While our tooling may not support every platform, you may find success running within a container image.

See "Cutting v1.15.0-alpha.2" under [References](#References) for an example Dockerfile.

**If you notice that [release tools] are not working as expected, please file an issue in [kubernetes/release].**

#### Release tooling

To leverage/contribute to our [release tools], Release Managers will need to fork and clone the [kubernetes/release] repo.

Building and publishing releases requires the latest revision of the release tools. The release tools can be compiled by running the following command from the [kubernetes/release] repository:

```shell
make release-tools
```

Additionally, the Kubernetes Release Toolbox (krel) requires the `cip-mm` tool to be present in the PATH. The `cip-mm` tool is used for promoting images/manifest. The instructions for installing it can be found in the [release image promotion document][image-promotion].

<!-- TODO: Remove the cip-mm requirement once krel starts consuming it as a library. -->

Release Managers primarily use an SSH key to authenticate to GitHub.

GitHub has documentation to assist in:

- [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
- [Forking a repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)

Additionally, `kubernetes/community` has a great [overview of the GitHub workflow](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/guide/github-workflow.md) we use across several Kubernetes org repositories.

Please take a moment to review the above documentation before continuing.

[image-promotion]: ./release-image-promotion.md

#### Google Cloud SDK

[Kubernetes release artifacts](/release-engineering/artifacts.md) are stored on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Release Managers will need to use the Google Cloud SDK to interact with release artifacts.

Google Cloud has [documentation on installing and configuring the Google Cloud SDK CLI tools](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts).

To authenticate the Google Cloud SDK tool with your GCP account, you can run:

```shell
gcloud auth login
```

It might ask you to define the default project, region, and similar settings. The project can be set to `kubernetes-release-test`, while other settings can be ignored.

In addition to `gcloud,` `gsutil` is required as well. By default, it comes with Google Cloud SDK.

#### Sending mail

At the end of a release, Release Managers will need to announce the new release to the community.

This can be done in one of two ways:

- The `krel announce` sub command -- A [`SENDGRID_API_KEY`](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys) will need to be configured correctly on your environment for this to work
  - If you haven't used SendGrid before, SendGrid might require you to go through the [Sender Identity Verification process][sendgrid-identity-verification] before you can send emails/announcements
- Manually -- Send the email notification manually to [kubernetes-announce][k-announce-list] and [kubernetes-dev][k-dev-list]. You can take contents of the announcement in one of the following ways:
  - By taking the contents from the Google Cloud Bucket: `gs://kubernetes-release/archive/anago-vX.Y.0-{alpha,beta,rc}.z`:
  - By using `krel announce` command with the `--print-only` flag
  - [Example subject](https://gcsweb.k8s.io/gcs/kubernetes-release/archive/anago-v1.17.0-rc.2/announcement-subject.txt)
  - [Example body](https://gcsweb.k8s.io/gcs/kubernetes-release/archive/anago-v1.17.0-rc.2/announcement.html)

[k-announce-list]: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-announce
[k-dev-list]: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-dev
[release tools]: https://github.com/kubernetes/release#tools
[kubernetes/release]: https://github.com/kubernetes/release
[sendgrid-identity-verification]: https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/sender-identity/

#### Skopeo

[Skopeo][skopeo] is a command line utility that performs various operations on container images and image repositories. Skopeo is not required for performing branch management tasks (if needed, Docker and other relevant tools can be used instead), however, it might be referred to by other guides. If you want to install Skopeo, you can follow the [official installation guide][skopeo-install].

[skopeo]: https://github.com/containers/skopeo
[skopeo-install]: https://github.com/containers/skopeo/blob/master/install.md

## Releases Management

**General overview**:

Public build artifacts are published and an email notification goes out to the community. You will become very familiar with the following commands over the course of the 3 month release cycle:

 - `krel gcbmgr` a krel wrapper around the `gcloud builds submit` command.
   - [gcbmgr](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/docs/krel/gcbmgr.md) documentation
 - `krel announce` a krel command to send the announcement email notification.

```shell
# Only for the official release: Inform the Google team to complete the corresponding Deb and RPM builds
export SENDGRID_API_KEY=<API_KEY>
krel announce --tag vX.Y.0-{alpha,beta,rc}.Z
```

There are more examples of the release process under the [References](#references) section.

It is also highly recommended to glance over the [Release Commands Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/release-engineering/role-handbooks/patch-release-team.md#release-commands-cheat-sheet).

**General bookkeeping**:

Prior to cutting a release version, [open a "Cut a Release" issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/new?template=cut-release.md&title=Cut+1.x.y-%7Balpha%2Cbeta%2Crc%7D.z+release) on [kubernetes/sig-release](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release).

On the issue template, there are comments describing the predefined items that need to be completed.

For the item `Screenshot unhealthy release branch testgrid boards...`:

You can use the `testgridshot` tool to create screenshots of unhealthy testgrid boards. `testgridshot` also takes care of uploading the screenshots to the `k8s-staging-releng` bucket, and generating the markdown table that you can post as a comment to the issue.

`testgridshot` is a Bash script located in the [kubernetes/release] repository. By default, it takes a screenshots of **blocking** and **informing** testgrid boards that have jobs that are **failing**. If you want to customize this, open the script in your preferred text editor and see the comment at the beginning of the script for possible customizations.

The script can be invoked in the following way:

```shell
./testgridshot <release>
```

`<release>` can be in form of `1.xy` (e.g. 1.19) or `master` (used when cutting alpha releases).

Eventually, you may want to include **flaking** jobs in addition to the **failing** jobs. In that case, you can invoke `testgridshot` such as:

```shell
STATES='FAILING FLAKY' ./testgridshot <release>
```

Once the script generates the markdown table, post it as a comment on the created issue. You can take a look at the [following comment](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/1249#issuecomment-696702503) as an example.

For the item `Collect metrics, links...`:

You can post a thread in the [#release-management] Slack channel and include links to the GCP build console. You can take a look at the [following thread][example-release-thread] as an example.

After the release process has been completed, you can use the `krel gcbmgr history` command to generate a markdown table with commands used to run the jobs, links to the GCB logs, and the information about each job.

```shell
krel gcbmgr history --branch release-1.xy --date-from <date-of-release>
```

_note:_ `krel gcbmgr history` command might require additional `gcloud` authentication. If you see an error, follow the steps mentioned in the error message to authenticate, and then re-run the command.

The generated table is copied to the created issue, as it can be seen in the [following issue for the v1.20.0-alpha.1 release](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/1249#issue-705792603).

After having thoroughly read the section on cutting a release version of the handbook, and that all items on the checklist have completed (you may include notes on events that was unique to cutting that release version as comments), close the issue with `/close` as a comment the issue thread.

### Alpha Releases

#### Alpha Stage

##### krel gcbmgr stage

To run `krel gcbmgr` to stage an Alpha release see [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/docs/krel/gcbmgr.md#alpha-stage).

This command should return relatively quickly and provide a link to GCP where you can track the progress of the build.
This takes time (approximately 1 hour). `krel gcbmgr` is building all the bits for a bunch of target operating systems and hardware architectures.

<!-- TODO: krel gcbmgr is not checking testgrid

Early in the release cycle, it is likely that the build might fail. By default the `gcbmgr stage master` command automatically looks for a place where [release master blocking tests](https://k8s-testgrid.appspot.com/sig-release-master-blocking) have green results, which traditionally has not happened in Kubernetes on an ongoing basis.

WE REALLY WANT (and need) TO GET THERE. Quality needs to be a continual focus. But in the meantime, acknowledging today especially for an early alpha or beta release, it is possible to just build via:

Rather than having `gcbmgr` pick a candidate by analyzing test data from the commit history that had no fails and building automatically from that point, we instead indicate we want to build explicitly from the last commit on the current branch.
-->

#### Alpha Release

The actual releasing may be intentionally delayed after staging. For example, the branch manager may stage a build from the head of the release branch late in the release cycle, doing so in the morning so that it is fully built and would be releasable in the afternoon (pending CI tests run against the head of the branch).

If the CI results are good and the release team approves, you can initiate the publishing portion of the release process. If staging the build only happened after the receipt of clean CI tests results, this will delay completing the entire release process for a release version (alpha,beta,rc,...).

This presumes reproducible builds and that the CI tests are meaningful relative to the release builds. There is always a risk that these diverge, and this needs to be managed broadly by the project and the release team.

##### krel gcbmgr release

Before running the release step, please refer to the [Image Promotion documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/release-engineering/role-handbooks/release-image-promotion.md).

Use the `--build-version=` as specified in the output when `krel gcbmgr` is done with the stage command.

To run `krel gcbmgr` to release an Alpha release see [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/docs/krel/gcbmgr.md#alpha-release).

This copies the staged build to public GCP buckets at well-known urls for the truncated release version string. The unique build staging identifier will subsequently be “v1.16.0-alpha.1”, even though the staged build had an “alpha.0” in its name.

This can be confusing. The v1.16.0-alpha.0 tag was created automatically in the past when the v1.15 branch was forked, but it wasn’t actually built.

##### Mock vs nomock

Any `krel gcbmgr` command without the `--nomock` flag is a dry run. It is highly encouraged to dry run first before letting `krel gcbmgr` take any actual impact on the release process. Mock building/releasing can help you verify that you have a working setup!

To get more information on `krel gcbmgr` default behavior, please see [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/docs/krel/gcbmgr.md#important-notes).

**Note: This run may fail. Mock builds can only be mock released. A nomock release requires a nomock build to be staged.**

Builds against the `master` branch are implicitly the next alpha. `krel gcbmgr` and `anago` automatically find and increment the current build number.

### Beta Releases

Before run the `official release step` please refer to the [Image Promotion documentation](./release-image-promotion.md).

To run `krel gcbmgr` to stage a Beta release see [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/docs/krel/gcbmgr.md#beta-stage).

And to run `krel gcbmgr` to release a Beta release see [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/docs/krel/gcbmgr.md#beta-release).

### Release Candidates

Builds against a `release-x.y` branch are implicitly the next RC (release candidate). `krel gcbmgr` and `anago` automatically find and increment the current build number.

**Note: If this is the first release (`rc.0`), there are additional tasks to complete. Please review them _COMPLETELY_ in the [Branch Creation section](#branch-creation), _before_ continuing.**

Before run the `official release step` please refer to the [Image Promotion documentation](./release-image-promotion.md).

Adding the `--rc` flag switches behavior on to building release candidates. Again `krel gcbmgr` and `anago` automatically find and increment the current build number.

To run `krel gcbmgr` to stage a Release Candidate see [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/docs/krel/gcbmgr.md#release-candidate-rc-stage).

To publish the build artifacts (release), as usual use the `--buildversion=` number as specified in the output when `krel gcbmgr` is done with the stage command.

To run `krel gcbmgr` to release a Release Candidate see [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/docs/krel/gcbmgr.md#release-candidate-rc-release).

In a perfect world, `rc.1` and the official release are the same commit. To get as close to that perfect state as we can, the following things should be considered:

1. PRs tagged with the release cycle milestone should have all merged onto the `master` branch:

   For example, there should be no open PRs tagged with the v1.18 milestone, `is:pr is:open milestone:v1.18`.

   You and the release team should push for PRs to get merged before the [code freeze](#code-freeze) is lifted or determine if the open PRs can be removed from the milestone and be merged in the next release cycle.

2. When to stage and release `rc.1`:

   Make sure that all the changes that have been merged onto `master`, make it onto the release branch. Run [`krel ff`](#branch-fast-forward) to see the state of the two branches and pull any remaining PRs from `master` onto the release branch.

   At this point in time, `master` and the release branch should have the same commits. Nothing new gets merged onto `master`, since [code freeze](#code-freeze) is not lifted. Therefore, it is safe to cut the release candidate.

3. Factors that determine if Code Freeze can be lifted:

   - Zero pending PRs and no open issues tagged with the release cycle milestone.
   - No failing X.Y-blocking tests, for example the [sig-release-1.18-blocking](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-1.18-blocking) dashboard should not have any red failing test builds.

   > **Note:** If there are non-zero pending PRs, open issues or failing tests, there is high confidence that the issue is understood and the solution can be [cherry picked](#cherry-picks) over to the release branch between the release candidate(s) and official release.

Technically we can keep [code freeze](#code-freeze) in place after `rc.1` was cut. However, we should aim at lifting code freeze relatively quickly after `rc.1`.

Otherwise we might have a mix of PRs against master, some have been merged in code freeze and for the milestone, just after `rc.1`, and others have been merged when code freeze has been lifted. We might miss this specific PR in the plethora of PRs that [tide] merges after [code thaw](#code-thaw), and we might miss that this PR actually needs to be cherry-picked into the release branch.

[tide]: https://git.k8s.io/test-infra/prow/tide

### Official Releases

Before run the `official release step` please refer to the [Image Promotion documentation](./release-image-promotion.md).

To run `krel gcbmgr` to stage an Official Release see [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/docs/krel/gcbmgr.md#official-stage) and to release an Official Release see [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/docs/krel/gcbmgr.md#official-release).

In addition to `v1.18.n` this will also build and stage the subsequent patch's
`rc.0`, in this example `v1.18.(n+1)-rc.0`. Similar to [creating a new branch](#branch-creation), the staging step will take about twice as long, the
release step will also take a couple of minutes more.

When staging is done, you may use the command `./gcbmgr release` with the `--buildversion=` specified as usual when `./gcbmgr stage` is done.
However, there is an embargo policy which requires the nomock release publication happens after 4 pm Pacific (see [Release Team Lead Handbook](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/release-team/role-handbooks/release-team-lead#week-12) for details), make sure to coordinates with other roles and follow the timeline.

To better prepare and see what to expect, this is a sequence of events that took place on past [official release days](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K0B91lgeEiJTbT602VloA5arb6AkaTif-MLryaHmlYc/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Security fixes

The Product Security Committee (PSC) may contact you via the [Security Release Team][security-release-team]
mailing list if there are security fixes needed on the release branch.

Once the release has been confirmed to contain security fixes, the Branch Manager must inform the current
Release Team Lead and Lead Shadows. Information pertaining to these fixes is considered need-to-know and should not be disseminated to anyone else on the Release Team.

You must not make any public announcements regarding these fixes unless the PSC tells you to.

See the [Security Release Process](https://git.k8s.io/security/security-release-process.md) doc for more details.

[security-release-team]: https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/forum/#!forum/security-release-team

#### Debian and RPM Packaging

[Packaging the Official Release](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/release-engineering/packaging.md) is by conducted by employees at Google. Once `./gcbmgr release --official ...` has completed, **before sending out the email notification**, contact the [Release Managers Google Group][release-managers-group] to notify them that an official release for `vX.Y` is complete and the release is ready to be packaged.

The entire packaging process including the build and validation of the builds could take around 3-4 hours. It is preferable to have the DEB and RPM files ready prior to sending out the release notification email since, people worldwide will attempt to download the official release. Since packaging uses the release tag, it is important to [validate the release process](#release-validation).

Once the .deb and .rpm packages are done building, you can `grep` for `X.Y` e.g. `1.16` in the [yum](https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/repos/kubernetes-el7-x86_64/repodata/primary.xml) and [apt](https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/dists/kubernetes-xenial/main/binary-amd64/Packages) repositories.

#### Release Validation

The following are some ways to determine if the release process was successful:

1. The build tag and release artifacts become [visible on GitHub at https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases)

2. The release is logged automatically by [k8s-release-robot](https://github.com/k8s-release-robot) in [k/sig-release](https://git.k8s.io/sig-release)

3. CHANGELOG-X.Y.md is automatically loaded into the kubernetes/kubernetes repo: [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.16.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.16.md)



### Post-release Activities

#### Update kubekins-e2e variants

Set the `K8S_RELEASE` marker for the current release variant to `stable-x.y` which was currently `latest-x.y` in the [`variants.yaml` file for `kubekins-e2e`](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/fa43d4a7a6c88c0dedd0db83b250cec485b60736/images/kubekins-e2e/variants.yaml). ([reference PR review comment](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/13870#discussion_r313628808))

#### Cut next alpha

Recall that an alpha.0 of the next minor release was created during [branch creation](#branch-creation).

The previously created alpha.0 is now several commits behind `master`.
As an example, see the [comparison between the `v1.18.0-alpha.0` (after 1.17 branch creation) and `v1.18.0-alpha.1` (after 1.17.0 release) tags](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/compare/v1.18.0-alpha.0...v1.18.0-alpha.1).

To assist downstream consumers of Kubernetes, a new alpha should be cut to bring our next release tag to the tip of `master`.

Get the latest build version at `master`:

```shell
gsutil cat gs://kubernetes-release-dev/ci/latest.txt
```

Begin the release process:

```shell
krel gcbmgr --stage --branch master --build-version=<version-from-previous-step>
```

Proceed with the [alpha release steps](#alpha-releases).

This section discusses the methods in managing commits on the `release-x.y` branch.

### Branch Creation

During a `rc.0` release our release tooling creates a new release branch named `release-x.y`, where `x` and `y` are the major and minor versions of the next release, respectively.

Behind the scenes `anago` is doing a git branch create and git push.

`prow`’s [`branchprotector`](https://git.k8s.io/test-infra/prow/cmd/branchprotector/README.md) runs every hour at 54 minutes past the hour and automatically adds [branch protection](https://help.github.com/articles/about-protected-branches/) to any new branch in the `kubernetes/kubernetes` repo.

New release branch creation (for example: `release-1.18`) also automatically triggers an alpha.0 build for the subsequent release (for example: [`v1.19.0-alpha.0`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.19.0-alpha.0)).

This means that the staging step will take about twice as long, as it will stage both versions `v1.18.0-rc.0` and `v1.19.0-alpha.0`. The release step will also be extended, but not substantially longer in time.

#### During staging

While the staging job is in progress, run through the following tasks, **_putting an explicit hold_** on any PRs (to be removed once the release branch has been created):

- [Update test-infra configurations](#update-test-infra-configurations)
  - [Update Slack branch whitelists](#update-slack-branch-whitelists)
  - [Update milestone appliers](#update-milestone-appliers)
  - [Update e2e variants](#update-e2e-variants)

#### After release branch creation

This being the first build from the newly created release branch, the publication of this build does not send out the typical changelog detail notification, but rather will only send a shorter message with subject line "[Kubernetes release-1.18 branch has been created](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-announce/2xV2uMF8TW4)".

Once the new `release-x.y` branch is created, the following tasks should take place as soon as possible:

- [Generate release branch jobs](#generate-release-branch-jobs)
- [Run `krel ff` approximately a day after the branch has been created](#branch-fast-forward)

### Update test-infra configurations

This takes place around week 6-7, as soon as the new [`release-x.y` branch is created](#branch-creation).

Before getting started, Branch Managers should:

- Fork the [test-infra repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra)
- Clone their fork of `kubernetes/test-infra`:

  ```shell
  git clone git@github.com:<username>/test-infra.git
  ```

- [Install Bazel](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install.html)

#### Update Slack branch whitelists

The Slack branch whitelist reports potentially dangerous or unexpected repository changes to Slack channels (for example, unauthorized pushes, rewrites, branch creations/deletions). The notification is part of the [Slack events Prow plugin](https://git.k8s.io/test-infra/prow/plugins/slackevents/slackevents.go).

- Find the current branch whitelist ([`config/prow/plugins.yaml`](https://git.k8s.io/test-infra/config/prow/plugins.yaml), search for `branch_whitelist:`)
- Remove the oldest release branch block
- Add an entry for the newest release branch
- Ensure only current [Release Managers](/release-managers.md#release-managers) are whitelisted for all `kubernetes/kubernetes` release branches

Here's an [example PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/15014).

#### Update milestone appliers

The [milestone applier plugin](https://git.k8s.io/test-infra/prow/plugins/milestoneapplier/milestoneapplier.go) automatically applies a GitHub milestone to pull requests after they have merged.

This only applies to repos that have the milestone applier configured and for pull requests that do not already have a milestone.

Update the `milestoneapplier` plugin configs for `kubernetes/kubernetes`:

- Remove config for the oldest release branch
- Add config for the current release branch

Here's an [example PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/15017).

#### Update e2e variants

Images used in Kubernetes e2e tests are generated via our [GCB Builder tool](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/images/builder/README.md).

The `variants.yaml` config file, used in conjunction with the GCB Builder, allows us to target various branches or branch combinations during CI tests. The `K8S_VERSION` variable maps to the version marker `latest-x.y.txt` file viewable in the [`kubernetes-release` GCS bucket](https://gcsweb.k8s.io/gcs/kubernetes-release/release/) for example, [`latest-1.17.txt`](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/latest-1.17.txt).

Update the [variants for the `kubekins-e2e` image](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/images/kubekins-e2e/variants.yaml).

- Remove the oldest release variant
- Add an entry for the newest release variant
- Ensure the following:
  - The `K8S_RELEASE` marker for `experimental` matches `master`
  - The `K8S_RELEASE` marker for the newest release variant is `latest-x.y`
  - The `K8S_RELEASE` marker for every other release variant is `stable-x.y`

Create a PR with this change and wait for it to be merged ([example PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/15015)).

**Wait for the `test-infra-push-kubekins-e2e` presubmit to finish (you can [check on prow](https://prow.k8s.io/?job=post-test-infra-push-kubekins-e2e)).**

**`git pull` latest from `master` before continuing.**

#### Generate release branch jobs

1. Generate the new release branch jobs:

   ```shell
   bazel run //releng:prepare_release_branch
   ```

1. Update release dashboards in the [Testgrid config](https://git.k8s.io/test-infra/config/testgrids/kubernetes/sig-release/config.yaml) ([example commit](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/15023/commits/cad8a3ce8ef3537568b12619634dff702b16cda7)).
   - Remove the oldest release `sig-release-<version>-{blocking,informing}` dashboards
   - Add dashboards for the current release e.g., `sig-release-1.17-{blocking,informing}`

1. Check for and resolve configuration errors:

   ```shell
   bazel test //config/... //hack:verify-all
   ```

1. Issue a PR with the new release branch job configurations ([example PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/15023)).

1. Once the PR has merged, verify that the new dashboards have been created and are populated with jobs

    Examples:
    - [sig-release-1.17-blocking](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-1.17-blocking)
    - [sig-release-1.17-informing](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-1.17-informing)

1. [Announce in #sig-release and #release-management](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C2C40FMNF/p1565746110248300?thread_ts=1565701466.241200&cid=C2C40FMNF) that this work has been completed

### Configure Merge Automation

Between the [Code Freeze](#code-freeze) and lifting Code Freeze ([Code Thaw](#code-thaw)) period, merging new code is restricted. The main focus is on fixing existing code and getting green test builds on Testgrid. Preventing new code is implemented by config changes for [tide]. The `master` and current release cycle branch (`release-x.y`) are the only branches affected during this period.

Code freeze initiates additional merge requirements, while Code thaw marks the switch back to the development phase. Look at the [release cycle timeline](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases) for the exact dates for code freeze and code thaw. Usually the the date for code thaw is flexible depending on pending PRs.

As Branch Manager, coordinate with the Release Lead on checking the exact config changes required to enable and disable merge restrictions.

#### Tide

Tide automates merges and is configured via a [config.yaml](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/prow/config.yaml) file. Tide identifies PRs that are mergeable using GitHub queries that correspond to the configuration. Here is an example of what the query config for `kubernetes/kubernetes` looks like without additional constraints related to the release cycle:

```yaml
  - repos:
    - kubernetes/kubernetes
    labels:
    - lgtm
    - approved
    - "cncf-cla: yes"
    missingLabels:
    - do-not-merge
    - do-not-merge/blocked-paths
    - do-not-merge/cherry-pick-not-approved
    - do-not-merge/hold
    - do-not-merge/invalid-owners-file
    - do-not-merge/release-note-label-needed
    - do-not-merge/work-in-progress
    - do-not-merge/needs-kind
    - do-not-merge/needs-sig
    - needs-rebase
```

During code freeze, two queries are used instead of just one for the `kubernetes/kubernetes` repo. One query handles the `master` and current release branches while the other query handles all other branches. The partition is achieved with the `includedBranches` and `excludedBranches` fields.

#### Code Freeze

Code freeze means the code is "frozen" and there will not be any further modifications from the developers.

Branch managers create the "freeze" by altering the Tide merge requirements for the `master` and current `release-x.y` branch from the other branches (enforced by Tide with two queries).

We only add additional merge requirements for PRs to these two branches for code freeze:

- PRs must be in the GitHub milestone for the current release.

Milestone requirements are configured by adding `milestone: vX.Y` to a query config.

It is also helpful to remind [#sig-testing](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/C09QZ4DQB) when code freeze starts so they know not to do any major changes.

```yaml
  - repos:
    - kubernetes/kubernetes
    milestone: v1.16
    includedBranches:
    - master
    - release-1.16
    labels:
    - lgtm
    - approved
    - "cncf-cla: yes"
    missingLabels:
      # as above...
  - repos:
    - kubernetes/kubernetes
    excludedBranches:
    - master
    - release-1.16
    labels:
    - lgtm
    - approved
    - "cncf-cla: yes"
    missingLabels:
      ...
```

Example PR:

 - [1.18](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/16603)
 - [1.17](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/15301)

#### Code Thaw

Code Thaw removes the release cycle merge restrictions and replaces the two queries with one single query. We remain in this state until the next Code Freeze.

```yaml
  - repos:
    - kubernetes/kubernetes
    labels:
    - lgtm
    - approved
    - "cncf-cla: yes"
    missingLabels:
    ...
```

Update the `milestoneapplier` plugin configs for the following repos to the **_next_** milestone:

- `kubernetes/enhancements`
- `kubernetes/kubernetes`
- `kubernetes/release`
- `kubernetes/sig-release`
- `kubernetes/test-infra`

Example PRs:

- [1.18](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/16821)

### Branch Fast Forward

Prior to running `krel ff`, you will need membership in the [Release Managers GitHub Group](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/teams/release-managers)

To compile `krel`, just install it from the [`git.k8s.io/release`](https://git.k8s.io/release) repository:

```shell
make release-tools
```

Command invocation:

```shell
krel ff --branch release-x.y
```

Where `x.y` is the is release cycle version e.g. `1.18`

This is done daily as soon as the `release-x.y` branch has been cut (which happens after `rc.0` is released).

Earlier in the release cycle, the exact time of running [`krel ff`] can be at the discretion of the branch manager; as agreed upon with the release lead.

Later in the release cycle, it will become more important to align with the release lead and the CI signal team.

The exact time for pulling in the changes from `master` to the release branch might depend on the features that are merging. Considerations could be:

- Run [`krel ff`] sooner, before `$bigFeature` so we have a signal in the release branch before that feature was brought in
- Run [`krel ff`] later, after `$theOtherFeature` has been merged, so we get signal on that feature from both the master and the release branch

The first time the [`krel ff`] executes, it will:

- clone `kubernetes/kubernetes` to a temporary directory (`/tmp/k8s`)
- precheck that the provided branch is a release branch and can be forwarded
- merge the latest master ref into the release branch
- push the results to the GitHub remote release branch

It is highly recommended to run the following `git` commands as shown below:

```shell
Validate things look okay before pushing…

Check for files left uncommitted using:

    git status -s

Validate the fast-forward commit using:

    git show

Validate the changes pulled in from master using:

    git log origin/release-1.16..HEAD
```

You should see something like this when running `git show`:

```shell
commit d17cd2356993283316b10491a4beaad0931bbff3
Merge: 35a287caa6 6348200c92
Author: Yang Li <idealhack@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 10 03:47:38 2019 +0000

    Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/master' into release-1.16
```

Sometimes the commit may or may not delete a Changelog.

It is critically important to run the following during code freeze. Look through the git log via:

```shell
git log origin/release-x.y..HEAD
```

Each and every commit ought to be something the release team has visibility into. Each merge commit indicates a PR number and owner. Invest time in researching these.

If unexpected code was merged to master, use your judgment on whether to escalate to the release team and SIG leadership associated with PR to question whether the commit is truly targeted for the release.

**The release team and the branch manager are the final safety guard on the release content.**

Upon a successful mock execution of `krel ff`, proceed with:
`krel ff --branch release-x.y --nomock`

Subsequent runs will simply be merging in changes from `master` to the branch, keeping the previous API fix-up commits on the branch.

Note that the merged commits from `krel ff` e.g. with `d17cd23569` from the above `git show` snippet will be tested against on Testgrid [sig-release-x.y-blocking].

Once code freeze is lifted ([code thaw](#code-thaw) occurred), then there will be no need to `krel ff` from `master` onto the release branch. Instead, PRs that need to be merged onto the release branch are cherry-picked over from `master`.

### Reverts

During code freeze it is especially important to first look at the list of commits on `master` since the prior fast forward, scanning their content and issues/PRs to ensure they are changes expected for this milestone.

**The merge-blocking mechanisms are relatively weak.**

It is possible still for some people to write directly to the repo (bypassing blocking mechanisms) as well as for unintentional milestone maintainers to approve a merge incorrectly. The branch manager is the last line of defense.

If code incorrectly merges onto `master` it should be reverted in `master`. Alternatively, release branch management must go to all cherry picks, picking around the incorrectly added commit.

### Cherry Picks

Once code freeze is lifted, and for the post-release patch management process, commits are cherry picked from `master`.

It's important to take note of [what is considered as a release blocking issue or PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/release-blocking-jobs.md) and identify PRs and issues as soon as possible. Ensure that there's work being done to release blocking PRs completed prior to the official release day.

Let the release lead know if there's not enough attention placed on the release blocking PR. This way we can prevent from prolonging the official release.

The current documentation in the [contributor guide for cherry picks](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-release/cherry-picks.md) should be generally sufficient. There are a couple prerequisites to running the script which are outlined in that guide.

The cherry pick script is also fairly self documenting in terms of how to invoke the command.

Running [cherry_pick_pull.sh](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/hack/cherry_pick_pull.sh) creates a cherry pick PR against the specified `release-x.y` branch. The content of the cherry pick PR is taken from a PR that was made against `master`. Once the appropriate approval is given to the cherry pick PR and has met the requirements set by the [k8s-ci-robot](https://github.com/k8s-ci-robot), this will trigger test re-runs on the PR. As soon as these tests all pass, add the `cherry-pick-approved` label.

For example, [#79044](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/79044) is the cherry pick PR of [#78999](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/78999). Once [#79044](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/79044) is tagged with the `cherry-pick-approved` label, Prow begins the merge onto the release branch.

There has been quite a bit of recent discussion (see: [1](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/2408), [2](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/1980)) around improving both the cherry pick process process and its documentation.

After the official release has been published, the [Release Managers](../../release-managers.md#release-managers) will take over in handling cherry picks. In the time between [code thaw](#code-thaw) and the official release, cherry picks are the responsibility of the branch management team.

Consider the following when assessing the cherry-picks:

- Check regularly if there are new cherry picks with
  [`is:open is:pr base:release-1.18 label:do-not-merge/cherry-pick-not-approved`][cherry-pick-query]
- Consider that each cherry-pick diverges the latest release candidate that has been cut from the bits to be released as the official release
- Engage with the cherry pick requester: How important is that cherry-pick, can it be pushed to a later release (patch or even minor), ... ?
- Discuss (especially controversial) cherry-picks in [#sig-release] or at the burndown meeting if you are unsure
- If certain cherry-picks merge, does this mean we want another release
  candidate, more time for the release candidate to soak (e.g. over the
  weekend)?

## Staging Repositories

The [publishing-bot](https://github.com/kubernetes/publishing-bot) is responsible for publishing the code in [staging](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/staging/src/k8s.io) to their own repositories.

The bot also syncs the Kubernetes version tags to the published repos, prefixed with `kubernetes-`. For example, if you check out the `kubernetes-1.16.0` tag in client-go, the code you get is exactly the same as if you check out the `v1.16.0` tag in Kubernetes, and change the directory to `staging/src/k8s.io/client-go`.

[client-go](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go) follows [semver](http://semver.org/) and has its own release process. This release process and the publishing-bot are maintained by SIG API Machinery. In case of any questions related to the published staging repos, please ask someone listed in the following [OWNERS](https://git.k8s.io/publishing-bot/OWNERS) file.

The bot runs every four hours, so it might take sometime for a new tag to appear on a published repository.

The client-go major release (e.g. `v1.18.0`) is released manually a day after the main Kubernetes release.

## Debugging

To debug `krel gcbmgr` you can set the log level to `debug` by doing `krel gcbmgr --log-level debug [args]`

You can also inspect the logs on the Google Cloud console.


## Search past builds

To search past `cloudbuilds` to make any kind of analysis and check metrics you can use the Google Cloud Console for that.
You can access [Google Cloud Build History](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds?project=kubernetes-release-test)

There you can see all the `cloudbuilds`  that already ran or if there is any one running in the moment you can see that as well.

To filter for a specific build or set of builds you can use the `Filter Builds` textbox. When you click there it opens a dropdown box to you select which kind of keys you want to filter.

For example you can select `Tags` and then add the tags you want to filter, like, `Tags: release-1.18 Status: Successful`. This query in the [Google Cloud Build](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds?project=kubernetes-release-test&pageState=(%22builds%22:(%22f%22:%22%255B%257B_22k_22_3A_22Tags_22_2C_22t_22_3A10_2C_22v_22_3A_22_5C_22release-1.18_5C_22_22_2C_22s_22_3Atrue_2C_22i_22_3A_22tags_22%257D_2C%257B_22k_22_3A_22Status_22_2C_22t_22_3A10_2C_22v_22_3A_22_5C_22Successful_5C_22_22_2C_22s_22_3Atrue_2C_22i_22_3A_22status_22%257D%255D%22)))


#### Limitation

Looks like in the Google Cloud Build History you cannot set more than one `tag` when using the `AND` operator. The query does not bring anything if you add, for example, `Tags: release-1.18 Tags: STAGE`.
Besides the fact that exists.
